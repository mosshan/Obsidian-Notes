look into
- what even is OOP?
- 


Notes
- Struggle with 
	- big stuff
		- backtracking
		- stack problems
			- but i think the logic is just funky sometimes
	- Minor stuff
		- slicing
		- indexes lol silly goofy
		- Implement class in python
- little stuff and hints to get through but to remember next time
	- sliding window
	- slicing
		- \[start: end: step\] -> not inclusive
	- range 
		- range(0,5) goes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 NOT inclusive
		- loop backwards = range(100, 0, -1) -> last argument is interval
	- XOR 
		- XOR number with itself = 0, XOR is commutative
	- Summations!
