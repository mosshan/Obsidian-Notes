#studytoolsandtechniques 
#### 1. Understand
- Ask clarifying questions + use examples to understand what the interviewer wants from the problem
	- including level of detail of implementation
- Choose "happy path" test input **diff than one provided** 
- Choose edge case inputs
	- For these, verify interviewer + you have same expected input + outputs

#### 2. Match
- see if prob matches category (like strings/arrays)
- See if it matches any strats or patterns within the category

#### 3. Plan
- sketch vizualizations 
- Write psuedocode
- Walk through high level implementation w an existing diagram

#### 4. Implement
- implement the solution 
	- Know what level of detail of implementation interviewer wants

#### 5. Review
- recheck algo solves problem by going through important examples
- go through as if debugging, assuming there is a bug

#### 6. Evaluate
- give time + space complexity
- discuss pros and cons of the solution
