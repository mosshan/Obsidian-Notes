Number bases
- binary is base 2, we use base 10
Logarithms
- to what power must we raise a certain base to get a number
- also how many times can we divide a number by base til we reach 1
- inverse of exponential
- log(8) = 3 -> we aassume base 2 (2 * 2* 2 = 8)
Permutations and Factorial
- set
	- distinct items, order doesnt matter
- permuation
	- ordering of set elements, order matters
	- n! if n is num of elements in a set
Subset
- how many subsets in a set?
	- for each element, we can include or not include like a light switch, 2 options for each
	- 2 ^n
Arithmetic Sequence
- sequence where diff btwn consecutive nums is constant
- Sum of arith sequence:
	- becomes O(n^2) in big o complexity
- Relevence?
	- nested loop complexity analysis
	- 
Geometric sequence
- ratio btwn consecutive nums is constant
Mod Arithmetic
- moddistribution
	- (a + b) Mod c = ((a modc) + (b mod c)) modc
