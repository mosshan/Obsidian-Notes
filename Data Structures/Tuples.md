Built in to Python
- collection that is ordered, unchangable (immutable), can contain duplicates
- Operations Time Complexities are similar to list
``` python
tuple = (1,2,3,1)
tuple[1] # output: 2
tuple * 3 # (3, 6, 9, 3)
len(tuple) # 4
tuple[0:2]

tuple.count(1) # returns occurence of an item
tuple.index(1) # returns index of 1 in array
```
